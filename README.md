# UtilitySlots
Adds additional accessory slots for non-combat and mobility accessories. Choosing between damage and movement speed may be balanced, but being slow isn't very fun.

* Seamless integration with other equipment pages and fast equip (right click)
* Dye slots and visibility toggles
* Tooltips indicate disabled combat effects
* API via `UtilityAccessories` for registering utility accessories

While the mod is carefully balanced, being able to equip frog legs, wings, frostpark boots and shiny red balloons is definitely a buff.
